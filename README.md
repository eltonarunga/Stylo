## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React & TypeScript
-   **Backend**: Node.js Serverless Functions (for most APIs)
-   **AI Models**: Google Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, `imagen-4.0-generate-001`, `veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview`)
-   **AI SDK**: `@google/genai`
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **Module Loading**: ES Modules with Import Maps
-   **Deployment**: Optimized for Vercel

## üöÄ Deployment on Vercel

This project is optimized for a seamless deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

1.  **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2.  **Create a new project** on your Vercel dashboard and import the forked repository.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    -   In the project settings on Vercel, navigate to "Environment Variables".
    -   Add a new variable named `API_KEY`.
    -   Paste your Google Gemini API key as the value.
    -   Ensure the variable is available to all environments (Production, Preview, Development).
4.  **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically detect the project structure and deploy it. The serverless functions in the `/api` directory will be built and deployed as well.

Your application will be live at the domain provided by Vercel. For local development, use the Vercel CLI (`vercel dev`).

## üîí Security Considerations

Security is a top priority for this application. Here are the key measures and considerations:

-   **API Key Protection**: For most features, the Gemini API key is stored as a server-side environment variable and is **never exposed to the client's browser**. All API calls to Gemini are routed through secure serverless functions.
-   **Veo API Key**: The video generation feature requires the user to select their own API key via a special dialog provided by the environment. This key is then used for client-side API calls to handle the long-running video generation process.
-   **Server-Side Input Validation**: All incoming requests to the API endpoints are strictly validated to prevent malformed data from being processed.
-   **Mock Authentication**: The sign-in flow is a **demonstration mock and is not secure for production use**. A production-ready implementation would require password hashing, secure user storage, and JWTs.
-   **Rate Limiting**: For a production deployment, it is highly recommended to implement rate limiting on the API endpoints to prevent abuse and control costs.
