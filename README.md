## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
-   A local development server that can run the frontend and the serverless function proxy (e.g., Vercel CLI, Netlify CLI).
-   A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stylo.git
    cd stylo
    ```

2.  **Configure API Key:**

    This application uses a backend proxy (`/api/generate`) to protect your API key. You need to make your key available as an environment variable to this server-side function.

    -   Create a file named `.env.local` (or equivalent for your platform) in the root of your project.
    -   Add your API key to this file:
        ```
        API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    -   Ensure that your deployment platform is configured to use this environment variable.

3.  **Run the application:**
    -   Start your local development server from the root of the project directory (e.g., `vercel dev`).
    -   The server will serve the frontend and make the `/api/generate` endpoint available.
    -   The application will open in your default browser.

## üîí Security

The Gemini API key is handled securely on the server-side by a proxy endpoint located in `api/generate.ts`. This endpoint receives requests from the frontend, adds the secret API key from its environment variables, and forwards the request to the Gemini API. This architecture ensures the API key is **never exposed in the browser**.
